Designated storage areas exist at every facility and vary between locked individual spaces accessed by clients to large containers staff check clients' items in and out of. Storage is important to give our clients the dignity and respect they deserve and provide safe environments at our programs.\n\nLifeMoves does not store belongings for anyone other than current clients. Clients must take all personal belongings with them at the time of their discharge. \n\nDonations \nDonations play a critical role in providing our programs with the resources needed to fulfill the mission of assisting our clients. Donations such as clothing, food, and hygiene supplies contribute to meeting our clientâ€™s basic needs. While seasonal supplies like back-to-school essentials, holiday contributions, and specialized donations such as electronics or services enhance our clients' feelings of dignity and respect. Programs vary across the timing and quantity of donations they can receive, and all donations are provided to clients or other community partners who may have a greater need.\n\nMaintenance \nTimely and ongoing maintenance"
