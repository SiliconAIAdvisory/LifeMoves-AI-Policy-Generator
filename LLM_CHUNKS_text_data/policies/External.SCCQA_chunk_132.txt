# A. The VI-SPDAT

Santa Clara County uses the Vulnerability Index – Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool (VI-SPDAT) created by OrgCode Consulting, Inc. and Community Solutions as the standard triage.

# Assessment Tool

This assessment will be used for all homeless individuals and households in Santa Clara County. There are five versions of the VI-SPDAT in use for different populations:

1. Individuals
2. Families
3. Transition Age Youth
4. Justice Discharge
5. Prevention

The VI-SPDAT is to be completed by all individuals and families who are homeless under Category 1 (Literally Homeless) and Category 4 (Fleeing Domestic Violence) of HUD’s definition of homelessness. The VI-SPDAT will be conducted as part of the standard HMIS intake.

The Prevention VI-SPDAT is used by the Homelessness Prevention System (HPS) pilot to assess eligibility for participation.

All assessed households that fall within the eligible score range for the HPS pilot are offered HPS prevention services.
