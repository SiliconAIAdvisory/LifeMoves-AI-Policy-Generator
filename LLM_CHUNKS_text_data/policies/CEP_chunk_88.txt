Title, Topic or Reference: LifeMoves Client Engagement Philosophy January 2024

 programs and our clients are often stigmatized by the larger community. Staff and clients collaborate to foster positive relationships with the surrounding community and to promote safety at the facility and surrounding area. Positive interactions, collaboration, and engagement with neighbors, local businesses, and community organizations is critical to our programs and clientsâ€™ integration into the community. Building positive rapport with our neighbors also helps us address any concerns or misconceptions that may exist and creates open communication for sharing of information and resources. 

The LifeMoves Good Neighbor Policy is comprehensive and tailored to each facility. All clients, businesses, agencies, and property owners within the neighborhood (neighbors); LifeMoves staff; and clients have a right to personal safety, to safe and quiet enjoyment of their properties and public spaces, to access services, and to meet their basic needs. 
The quality of life and the overall character of the neighborhood can be greatly influenced by the behavior of staff and clients. Displaying a respectful and courteous attitude makes the neighborhood a more pleasant place to work and live. Staff and clients are expected to exercise good judgment and be sensitive to the needs of their neighbors. Clients should not loiter at nearby locations.
