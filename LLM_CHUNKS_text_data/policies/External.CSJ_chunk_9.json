When staff receive calls or inquiries regarding participants from persons or organizations for whom there is no ROI, staff inform the caller/inquirer that without an ROI, the site cannot discuss the participant.\n\n# Equity\n\nCity of San José EIH sites are committed to ensuring equity in service delivery, housing placements, housing retention, and/or other means of affirming race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, disability, or age. Further, the City of San Jose sites are committed to serving, with equity, all ethnicities, races, or other groups that are overrepresented in a program serving the homeless, or among persons experiencing homelessness.\n\n# Harm Reduction\n\nCity of San José EIH sites use a harm reduction approach, which incorporates a spectrum of strategies that includes safer use, managed use, abstinence, meeting people who use substances “where they’re at,” and addressing conditions of use along with the use itself. Note: harm reduction requires that interventions and policies designed to serve participants who use substances reflect specific individual and community needs; there is no universal definition of or formula for implementing harm reduction. Each EIH site establishes a harm reduction approach that suits the site and program participants"
