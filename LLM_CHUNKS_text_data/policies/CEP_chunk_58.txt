 is on access control
Lockdown/Barricade- emergency procedure when there is a threat to the facility
Evacuation- emergency procedure to leave the facility most often utilized for fire
Health and First Aid- emergency and non-emergency procedures to handle illness, contagious diseases such as COVID-19 and TB, accidents, injuries, and death at facilities

In an emergency, staff are trained to follow emergency procedures and the direction of emergency personnel calmly and quietly. Program staff call 911 if necessary and use an internal emergency communication alert system to communicate with others. In an emergency, clients may be encouraged to call 911 if staff are unable to do so. Staff and clients are responsible for reviewing evacuation and other safety plans provided in the safety area and during monthly meetings.
Examples of extreme emergencies: 
•Major facility incident (roof collapse, extreme flooding, long term power outage, broken HVAC)
•Active shooter/active shooter in area
•Fire
•Natural disasters (earthquake, landslide, flood, mudslide)
•Assault with a weapon
