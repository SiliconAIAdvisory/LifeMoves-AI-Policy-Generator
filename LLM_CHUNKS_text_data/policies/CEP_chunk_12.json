Additionally, it is important to meet the client where they are during this time and if a client has any basic needs this is the first thing to address. In the Foundations Phase, clients need a warm welcome, to build trust in staff, absorb information about the program, to de-stress and take a breath, and assess what they need to move forward.  This early phase is key in building rapport and starting to motivate clients around working towards goals. During the Foundations Phase, clients and staff enter into an agreement about services provided and the collaborative process. The information collected during these touchpoints provides data for LifeMoves to better understand the clients we serve and shape the individual plan we tailor with each client.
