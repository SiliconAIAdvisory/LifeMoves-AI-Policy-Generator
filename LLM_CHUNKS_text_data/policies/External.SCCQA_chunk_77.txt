Santa Clara Countywide Quality Assurance Standards for Homeless Housing & Service Programs

 re-housing is the best approach.

RRH programs will adopt a housing first approach and take all reasonable steps to reduce barriers to housing, including working with landlords to limit the criteria used to exclude applicants or evict participants.

Unless required by law or as a condition of a particular source of funding, programs will not screen out or exclude participants based on any of the following:

# A. Failure to participate in supportive services or make progress on a service plan

# B. Having too little or no income

# C. Refusal to participate in drug tests

# D. Active or history of substance abuse

# E. Experience of domestic violence (e.g. lack of a protective order, period of separation, etc.)

# F. Credit or eviction history

# G. Failure to participate in a probation or parole program

# Regarding Income

Households must demonstrate at point of program enrollment their ability and/or willingness to increase their income and/or decrease expenses and transition off the subsidy within the specified timeframe.

# Regarding Rent to Income Ratio

Taking into account a householdâ€™s total income and expenses, all Move-In Assistance only households should be able to demonstrate their permanent housing unit will be sustainable going forward.

# Regarding Other Eligibility Requirements
