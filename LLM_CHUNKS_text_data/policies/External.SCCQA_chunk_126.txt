Santa Clara Countywide Quality Assurance Standards for Homeless Housing & Service Programs

The Santa Clara County CoC is committed to adopting a Housing First approach and reducing barriers for accessing housing and services. Individuals are not screened out of the assessment process due to perceived or actual barriers to housing or services, including, but not limited to, too little or no income, active or a history of substance abuse, domestic violence history, resistance to receiving services, the type or extent of a disability or related services or supports that are needed, history of evictions or poor credit, lease violations or history of not being a leaseholder, or criminal record.

All locations where persons are likely to access or attempt to access the coordinated assessment system will include signs or brochures displayed in prominent locations informing participants of their right to file a non-discrimination complaint and containing the contact information needed to file a non-discrimination complaint. The requirements associated with filing a non-discrimination complaint, if any, will be included on the signs or brochures.
