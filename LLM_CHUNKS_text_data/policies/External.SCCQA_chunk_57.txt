 Role of the Case Manager and the OSH Program Manager

The case manager will assist the participant to avoid jeopardizing their housing placement and participation in the CoC Program. The case manager will inform the participant when his or her behaviors may lead to termination from the program and will develop a written behavioral contract with the participant to resolve the issues that may result in program termination and consequent eviction from the housing unit.
