While for most of our clients, program completion entails securing permanent housing. While for other clients, it means placement into a more appropriate program or location, including residential treatment program, hospice care, or other medical facility. \nWritten Warnings\nWritten warnings may be given to clients as part of a structured and supportive approach to address and correct non-compliant behaviors or situations. Clients are provided the rules and guidelines at intake and given clear information regarding expected behavior. Warnings are utilized as a tool to alert clients and case managers to what can be worked on in their case plan rather than as a punitive tool. For example, a case manager and client may agree to keeping their unit clean for three weeks as a measurable task after the client has received a written warning about their unit space. In certain circumstances, including but not limited to criminal activity, safety concerns and aggressive/threatening behavior, clients may be terminated immediately without a written warning notice. \n\nWritten warnings may be given to clients for the following:\nViolations of program policies, rules, or community guidelines\nBehaviors or actions that are disruptive, maladaptive, or abusive to other individuals or to the community"
