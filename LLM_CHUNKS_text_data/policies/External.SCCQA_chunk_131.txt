Coordinated assessment outreach will be designed to ensure the coordinated access process is available to all eligible persons regardless of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, familial status, disability, actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. Coordinated assessment outreach and any marketing materials will clearly convey that access points are accessible to all sub-populations.

Outreach will be conducted by existing outreach teams and programs in the community that act as coordinated assessment access points, including outreach resources that specifically target people experiencing chronic homelessness, veterans, families with children, youth, LGBTQ youth, and survivors of domestic violence and human trafficking. Culturally competent outreach resources with strong existing ties to the community’s most vulnerable populations will serve as coordinated entry access points to ensure that all subpopulations access coordinated assessment. Outreach will be available in the following languages to meet the needs of minority, ethnic, and groups with Limited English Proficiency (LEP): Spanish, Vietnamese, Tagalog and Mandarin.
