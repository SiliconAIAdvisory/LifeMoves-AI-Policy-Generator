Sites will determine eligibility without regard to actual or perceived sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. EIH sites adhere to HUD’s Equal Access Final Rule, HUD’s Gender Identity Final Rule, and the Fair Housing Act (see HUD’s guidance on the application of the Fair Housing Act to the use of criminal records).³\n\n# Reasonable Accommodation\n\nCity of San José EIH sites make reasonable accommodations so participants can engage in the housing and services offered through all EIH programs. A reasonable accommodation is a change, exception or adjustment to a program, service, building or dwelling unit that will allow a qualified person to participate fully in a program, take advantage of a service, and/or live in a unit. Reasonable accommodations apply to people who have a physical, mental, or behavioral disability. EIH sites will allow participants to make a reasonable accommodation request to aid a physical and/or mental health disability. Individuals with other needs, for example, those with dietary restrictions (e.g., kosher, Halal, vegetarian, gluten-free) may also be entitled to accommodation if such accommodation is necessary to allow the individual to fully take advantage of the service. While EIH participants can make informal requests to case managers and/or program directors as soon"
