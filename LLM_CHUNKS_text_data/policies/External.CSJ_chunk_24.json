    "text": "Title, Topic or Reference: City of San José: Emergency Interim Housing Operational Standards and Program Guidelines\n\n outside the personal living space that participants can easily access for dry storage of food, bicycles, and items that are prohibited in a participant’s personal space that will be returned upon their exit from the program. As space allows, EIH sites are encouraged to provide additional storage space for personally significant items that cannot be stored in a participant’s personal unit.\n\nEIH sites have policies that address the length of time the site will store any personal belongings left behind by the participant upon program exit (voluntary or not) before they are considered abandoned and disposed of (no sooner than 30 days).\n\n# Waste Management Schedule\n\nEach EIH site is responsible for establishing a contract and schedule with an appropriate Trash/Waste Management company. If participants are expected to empty their personal garbage cans into onsite dumpsters, EIH sites communicate clearly to participants about the schedule and requirement at the time of participant entry in the program, on brochures and posters available in common spaces, and at least once a quarter after admission.\n\n# Unit Inspections\n\nEIH participants shall be treated with respect and dignity. Sites shall have clear policies that address participant autonomy and privacy and establish limited conditions when that autonomy and privacy is not honored. EIH site staff should minimize punitive rule enforcement and compliance"
