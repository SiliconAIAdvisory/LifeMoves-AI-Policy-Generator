Any individual dissatisfied with the application of the program regulations, service by the staff or refusal from the program may file a grievance.’ These are also reviewed by the Program Director and handled accordingly.\n\nLifeMoves encourages clients to provide feedback while in program and ensures there is ample opportunity to do so. Feedback may be provided during meetings or in less formal settings. At times, our teams will hold focus groups for groups of clients to weigh in on specific procedures. For clients who would like to provide anonymous feedback, every facility has an anonymous feedback box that is available. Feedback left in this box is reviewed by the Program Director at that facility. The City of San José will install an evaluation and feedback kiosk to engage with participants and gain feedback on services through City-developed pre-loaded surveys. Clients will have the opportunity to provide recommendations and information about their experience at any time. Customized reports will inform the City of San José and LifeMoves on how to make improvements. Additionally, LifeMoves has a grievance form that is available to clients ‘to redress any conditions they believe to be unfair. Any individual dissatisfied with the application of the program regulations, service by the staff or refusal from the program may file a grievance.’"
