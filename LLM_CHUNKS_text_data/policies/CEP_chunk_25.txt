Title, Topic or Reference: LifeMoves Client Engagement Philosophy January 2024

 health care, housing, benefits, domestic violence, immigration, and elderly or child abuse. LifeMoves also supports clients who have been in state prisons, providing services for education, employment, and housing. Some clients benefit from referrals to court programs that can reduce traffic fines, expunge some criminal backgrounds, and address misdemeanor convictions which reduces barriers to employment and housing. LifeMoves Case Managers collaborate with external partners to provide support to clients experiencing domestic violence, providing legal advocacy, and assistance with restraining orders. Additionally, staff support our undocumented clients with a range of services, including getting access to programs, and partnering with local organizations for housing, medical services, and education.
