# Search Policies

1. Intrusive means to search will be utilized. The more intrusive the search, the more compelling the circumstances must be to justify the search.
2. Searches must be made in a reasonable manner with respect for the individual's dignity and privacy. Searches may only be conducted to the extent required in order to find a weapon, illegal material, drugs or alcohol. (For example, if a gun is suspected to be in a person's possession, a locker may be searched but not a wallet.)
3. Before a search is conducted, the client must be given an opportunity to voluntarily consent to a search.
4. If the person does not consent to the search, and "probable cause" exists to search, the person must be given the choice of being discharged or being searched.
5. Whenever possible, the individual must be given an opportunity to be present during all inspections of his or her belongings.
6. If a search is conducted, the following information must be documented in the person's record or if individual records are not kept
