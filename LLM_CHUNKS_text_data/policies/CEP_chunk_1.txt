Client Engagement Philosophy 
January 2024



PREFACE
The purpose of the Client Engagement Philosophy (CEP) document is to articulate LifeMoves' methodology in engaging with our client community, spotlight significant program milestones, and delineate the operational mechanisms that underpin the delivery of services. These operational levers play a pivotal role in maximizing consistency across our programs. This document takes implicit knowledge of practices and turns them into an explicit & visual model that can be refined, verified, and repeated.
