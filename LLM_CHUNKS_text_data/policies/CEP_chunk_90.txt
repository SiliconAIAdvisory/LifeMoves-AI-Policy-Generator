Moves conducts regular inspections to ensure safety, program rules compliance, fire safety and pest control. They are utilized by staff to identify any potential concerns before they escalate further. There are three types of inspections our staff utilize: 1) Health and Safety: LifeMoves staff check spaces to identify potential maintenance needs or health and safety hazards. These may occur routinely or on an as needed basis; 2) Facility: LifeMoves staff check units, beds, and commons spaces for safety, cleanliness, and maintenance needs on a weekly basis; 3) Intake: LifeMoves staff check belongings at intake to ensure health, safety, and wellness of all clients. The two facility inspections (1, 2) are utilized as a tool for assistance and support, providing an opportunity for staff to identify clients who may need additional support and connect clients with resources or other supportive interventions. Additionally, a well-maintained living environment contributes to a positive atmosphere, positively impacts the mental well-being of clients, and fosters a sense of dignity. Tracking inspections of the facility and living spaces can be useful for tracking trends and monitoring for improvement needs. The third type of inspection is utilized primarily to ensure the safety, security, and well-being of all individuals at the facility
