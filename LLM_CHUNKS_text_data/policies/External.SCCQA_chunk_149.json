However, some projects have requirements from their funders that may conflict with coordinated assessment. In those situations, OSH will work with the provider to determine the best possible way to participate in coordinated assessment.\n\n# VIII.\n\n# Safeguards for Domestic Violence Survivors\n\nFamilies and individuals will not be denied access to the coordinated assessment process on the basis that they are survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or trafficking. Such individuals will have safe and confidential access to the coordinated assessment process and victim service providers, and immediate access to emergency services such as domestic violence hotlines and shelter, as well"
