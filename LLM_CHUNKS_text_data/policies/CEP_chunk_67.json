LifeMoves provides ongoing support and systems for staff regarding proper documentation procedures, including maintaining case notes, incident reports, shift log notes, and other information required to run effective and compliant programs. LifeMoves staff balance protecting privacy and communicating internally and with partners (when a Release of Information (ROI) is signed) to provide clients with the best support possible. LifeMoves staff are mandated reporters, which means staff will report to Child Protective Services, Adult Protective Services, and will report if someone is a threat to themselves or others. All staff must agree in writing to security practices before being granted access to both the San Mateo County and Santa Clara County Human Management Information Systems (HMIS) and the internal LifeMoves performance management database. Additionally, in San Mateo County, LifeMoves participates in Assembly Bill 210 – Homeless Adult and Family Multidisciplinary Team Members, which permits multidisciplinary personnel teams of Participating Agencies to share and exchange information made confidential by State law to facilitate the expedited identification, assessment, and linkage of homeless adults and families to housing and supportive services within the County. \nConfidentiality is critical in our clients’ rights to privacy"
