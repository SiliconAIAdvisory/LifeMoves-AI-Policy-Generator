PAC members are encouraged to participate by having each EIH site provide stipends, such as gift cards and by serving meals and providing childcare during meetings.\n\n# Peer-to-Peer Opportunities\n\nOne of the most essential components of EIH is to assist individuals with finding employment, which lead to long-term stability and positive health and housing outcomes. The City of San José encourages EIH sites to develop programs that engage participants and other people with lived experience onsite to expand living-wage employment. Programs that provide hands-on support to participants to secure jobs that will enable them to afford housing once short-term assistance is phased out will help participants overcome the barriers of rising housing costs, inflation, and prolonged unemployment. EIH sites may engage participants in peer-to-peer volunteering to increase job opportunities and earn a living wage.\n\nEIH sites should explore hiring participants or former participants as Participant Service Coordinators. The Participant Service Coordinator position is defined as a person-centered role aimed at building authentic relationships with participants. Coordinators may be supervised by onsite leadership and advance within the program by stepping into larger responsibilities and leadership roles. Participant Service Coordinators can also play an important role in promoting participant safety but do not have punitive responsibilities.\n\nEIH"
