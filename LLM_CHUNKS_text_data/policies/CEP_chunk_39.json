For example, if analysis shows that in a specific program 95% of the clients have a substance use disorder based on assessment data, then LifeMoves can justify with data-informed evidence the need for increasing funding for substance use treatment. If a site has an employment workshop and finds out that none of the participants ended up getting jobs, they can use that data to revamp the employment workshops as well as identify and address other potential causes.\nData Usage\nLifeMoves aims to enhance and broaden the effective use of information systems to improve the experience for everyone involved: clients, programs staff and admin teams. By implementing robust systems and ensuring their consistent use, our clients receive more individualized support to identify and manage individual needs, goals, and priorities. Our staff benefit from smoother documentation processes and improved information sharing, enabling them to utilize an aggregate lens to identify trends, correlations, and potential for change. This approach allows us to maximize value to clients through staff efficiencies, focusing attention on the next best steps and potential obstacles. Program management staff gain deeper insights into the performance and outcomes of their programs, leading to a clearer understanding of organization-wide trends and opportunities.\n\nOutcomes"
