 A. In compliance with Cal/ OSHA Interim Tuberculosis Control Enforcement Guidelines, shelters must:

1. annually test employees for Tuberculosis (TB), in accordance with current criteria recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;
2. have written criteria to identify individuals who are suspected of having infectious TB;
3. have written TB exposure control procedures;
4. provide employees and residents with proper medical evaluation and preventative therapy;
5. provide TB prevention training to employees; and
6. maintain proper documentation of employee TB prevention training, TB exposure incidents, and diagnosed TB cases.

# B. Staff use "universal precautions" when disposing of child/infant items such as diapers, tissues, band-aids, etc. Gloves and plastic bags are used when handling and disposing of these items.

# C. The program notifies clients anytime there is a possibility that they were exposed to a communicable disease that is spread through casual contact. Notification must include posting a written warning about possible exposure in a conspicuous location and in all appropriate languages or in a fashion readily accessible to accommodate non-hearing and sight impaired individuals. The warning includes the date of the exposure, the disease, the onset time of the disease, its symptoms and how it is treated.
