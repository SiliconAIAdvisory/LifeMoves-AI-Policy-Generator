Program Safety
Safety Philosophy
Safety is a critical part of the culture at LifeMoves for clients, employees, volunteers, partners and anyone who interacts with our programs. LifeMoves has both a comprehensive Health Management Plan and Crisis Management Plan, which staff are trained on and provided resources to ensure they can administer the plans fully. Safety plans and policies are created, updated, maintained, and implemented by the Safety Manager and tracked through the internal incident report system. Examples of safety plans and policies include but are not limited to The Big Five, First Aid, Infection Control, and weapons policy. 
Health Management
The health and wellness of our clients and staff is a crucial part of the safety culture at LifeMoves. Operating facilities where people live and work create unique challenges for maintaining the health and wellness of all those in the environment. Staff work with experts to maintain quality health standards throughout our facilities and have the necessary reporting information and handling information for health and wellness situations.
