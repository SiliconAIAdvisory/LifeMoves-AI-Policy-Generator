Title, Topic or Reference: LifeMoves Client Engagement Philosophy January 2024

less Engagement: LifeMoves believes consistency is key to client progress. The way we embody this ranges from routine check-ins with clients to consistently being ready to support a client when they come to us and meeting them on their terms. Engagement should be flexible and voluntary.
Multi-Disciplinary Collaboration: LifeMoves leverages professionals across multiple fields and organizations, collaborating to support clients in their various needs and goals. 
Cultures we foster
Safety: LifeMoves believes every person deserves to be in a safe environment; it is every staff and client’s responsibility to maintain a dignified, clean, welcoming, and safe space.
Data-Driven: LifeMoves places strong emphasis on gathering information about clients and their circumstances, documenting engagement with clients and the results of that engagement and soliciting feedback directly from clients. By collecting and analyzing this data, the organization tracks its performance, identifies areas for improvement, and measures its impact on the community. This allows the agency to make informed decisions, understand the current capacity, and strategically plan for the future. 
Open & Transparent: LifeMoves strives to be open and transparent in all aspects of our work both internally within Programs, externally to partners, and most importantly to our clientele.
