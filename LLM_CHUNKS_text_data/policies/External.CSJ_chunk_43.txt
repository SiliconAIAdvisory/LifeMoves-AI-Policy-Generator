EIH sites have policies in place for emergency procedures to ensure staff notify participants of a fire or other emergency. Policies describe how the site will relocate and evacuate, and a designated Evacuation Area Map is posted at different areas throughout the site. Policies include emergency vehicle ingress and egress rules. A fire safety map of the site is maintained and provided to the San José Fire Department. EIH sites prohibit recreational fires within the site and prohibit open flames within the personal living spaces. Sites determine if onsite barbecues are permitted based on San José Fire Department safety recommendations.

All EIH sites are responsible for annual fire safety preventive maintenance, monthly checks of all smoke alarms to ensure they are in working order and replaced with new batteries, quarterly checks of outlets to ensure safety (and to make repairs as needed), maintenance of systems and equipment installed to prevent or control fires, and maintenance and control of fuel hazard sources. Fire extinguishers are accessible throughout the site by staff, participants, and visitors. Smoke detectors and carbon monoxide alarms are installed in units and common buildings and are inspected to insure they are functional and replaced if they are not functional.
