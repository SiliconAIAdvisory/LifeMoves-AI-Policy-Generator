# Protection Against Unreasonable Searches and Seizures

A. Programmatic or Routine Searches: Routine or programmatic searches are searches or inspections that do not target individual clients or residents, but are conducted for all clients on a routine basis according to a program’s written policies and procedures. Programmatic or routine searches include routine bag checks when clients enter program facilities, and room inspections for purposes of pest control.

# 1. Searches

Searches may only be conducted on a programmatic or routine basis when the program has a sufficiently compelling policy reason to conduct such searches, and the search is the least intrusive means to accomplish the goal.

2. Programmatic or routine searches are permitted only within program facilities, or as a condition to entry to a program facility.

3. Programs must have written policies and procedures regarding when and how program staff will conduct routine searches and what will be done with items of client property that are not permitted in the program facility.

4. Clients must be informed of the program’s policies and procedures regarding routine searches, including storage of items not permitted in the program facility, treatment of illegal or dangerous items, and any consequences to the client
