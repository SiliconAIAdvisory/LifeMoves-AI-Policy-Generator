Daily Wellness Checks 
Wellness checks serve multiple purposes in our work with clients. First, they are used to monitor physical health, mental well-being, and overall safety and stability. Wellness checks help staff identify any emerging issues or concerns before they escalate into crisis situations and help our staff build rapport and trust with clients that is critical when working on individual goals. Staff utilize wellness checks to provide emotional support, resources, and monitor progress. Also, staff can ensure basic needs are met and enhance accountability with our clients when they know someone will be checking in with them daily. LifeMoves staff check in with people in a variety of ways and spaces including but not limited to when clients enter and exit the facility, during meals or other events, or going to specific units if they have not seen someone throughout the day. 

Your health, safety, and wellbeing are important to us. Staff check in with our clients on a daily basis as people enter and exit the facility, during community meal times, workshops, and other events, and may come by units to see how people are doing and any services they may need.
