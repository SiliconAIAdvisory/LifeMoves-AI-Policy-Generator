Sites should clearly communicate to participants that the intention is not to “time out” of their program and be displaced back onto the streets, but instead is to ensure people have sufficient time to prepare and move into permanent housing destinations.\n\nhousing. Longer stays in EIH provide time for participants to acclimate to a new environment, build trust with onsite staff, and ultimately have a more successful program leading to more successful overall outcomes. Sites clearly communicate program expectations and requirements to mitigate participants’ anxieties and concerns about returning to homelessness.\n\nWhile EIH program duration is up to 12 months, it may be extended for higher-acuity program participants. It may also be extended when EIH site participants are nearing their program time limits and are ineligible for an extension but cannot access any open shelter beds. In these instances, EIH sites call the Here4You Call Center to secure shelter beds"
