Physical Health Moves
Healthy adults are more likely to be able to maintain a job and remain housed than adults in poor health or with chronic medical conditions. Additionally, adults who can perform their activities of daily living (ADLs) or have the necessary support to perform these tasks are more likely to remain housed. Many LifeMoves clients are at higher risk for medical complications than the general public; some are elderly, with chronic conditions that have been untreated; others are veterans with medical vulnerabilities. Our Case Managers assist clients with finding and enrolling in available insurance coverages, and for clients needing medical services or support, LifeMoves works in partnerships with local public health programs and community partners to get our clients the care they need. For many clients, addressing chronic or underlying health conditions is often a necessary first step on their journey of returning to stable housing.
Legal Moves
Legal matters can often affect the ease of finding and maintaining a place to live as well as where someone may be able to live. Case Managers connect clients to legal aid and pro bono services for specialized support. Additionally, staff provide resources and support in legal matters including health care, housing, benefits, domestic violence, immigration, and elderly or child abuse. LifeMoves
