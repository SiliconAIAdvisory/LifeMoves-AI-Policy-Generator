Service Animal / Emotional Support Animal Agreement

Per the American Disabilities Act, LifeMoves at Mountain View provides accommodations for service animals. According to the ADA, only dogs can be certified as service animals. 
Definition of a Service Animal:
A service animal is a dog that is individually trained to do work or perform tasks for a person with a disability. Examples of such work or tasks include guiding people who are visually impaired, reminding a person with mental illness to take their prescribed medications, calming a person with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) during an anxiety attack, etc. 
Service animals are working animals, they are not pets. The work or task a dog has been trained to provide must be directly related to the person’s disability. Dogs whose sole function is to provide comfort or emotional support do not qualify as a service animal under the ADA.
LifeMoves is not legally required to accommodate Emotional Support Animals (ESA) and will only do so under special request. This request must be made prior to the client’s intake and will be considered by the Program Director or Associate Program Director. Requests made after intake will not be considered.
