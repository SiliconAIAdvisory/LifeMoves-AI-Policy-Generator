 not be used for housing, sleeping, or storage. Vehicles must be registered, in working condition, and must not present a blight issue (e.g., kept free of garbage). Recognizing that participants may have lost key registration items over the course of their homelessness and to minimize barriers to parking on site, participants whose vehicles lack proper registration are given at least 90 days to work with staff to secure items necessary for parking registration.

# Smoking

EIH sites may limit smoking so that it is not permitted inside or around or in personal living spaces or common areas. If smoking is limited to designated areas only, sites communicate their policies to participants at the time of participant entry in the program, on brochures and posters available in common spaces, and at least once a quarter after admission.

# Mail

All EIH sites provide participants with use of a mailing address while they are in the program.

# Telephone and Broadband Access

Each EIH site offers at least one mobile phone that is available for use by participants. EIH sites also make available broadband access free of charge to participants, which provide 24/7 access to the internet. Internet provider and site setup is determined by the City of San José.
