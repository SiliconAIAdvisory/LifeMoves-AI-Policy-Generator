# Security

EIH sites prioritize securing the perimeter and keeping participants safe from events going on outside, rather than imposing restrictions internally and intruding on participants’ sense of agency and privacy.

# Hybrid Security Approach

Security is valued by EIH participants. Providing security through private contractors and research in pilot sites indicates that private security is unnecessary during business hours. During the pilot, it was shown that the security measures needed at EIH sites can be achieved through site staff, so long as security policies are clear and staff are trained.

Recognizing that EIH staff already receive extensive training about onsite security with a specialized focus on crisis prevention and intervention, de-escalation, and administering first aid and Narcan, EIH sites implement a hybrid approach with private security only providing supervision.
