Cars/Parking 
Transportation is an important resource for our clients to have mobility and autonomy to access resources that are not located at LifeMoves facilities. Programs where space permits may allow clients to check in their vehicles and park them in on-site parking lots. Additionally, our staff utilize Lyft rides or program vehicles to ensure clients have transportation to appointments and resources that support their case plan and goals.

•	Please be mindful:  All clients with cars must submit vehicle information to the front desk upon 
intake. Provide make, model, color, and license plate of the car(s). If this information is not 
provided and a client parks their car in any of the lots, it could be towed at the owner’s expense. 
•	Only certified placard holders can access handicap spaces. 
•	Car repairs and car washing are not permitted on the property (this includes our parking lots).
•	All transportation, like Lyft, Uber, Taxi Cabs, etc. are required to pick up clients on the street
