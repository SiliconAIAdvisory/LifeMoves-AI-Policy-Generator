Clients who receive a warning for a serious offense, or more than one warning for lesser infractions, may be discharged and terminated from the program.\n\nGrounds for Discharge\nOur programs have a responsibility to provide safe and secure environments for everyone at our various locations of operation. Having clearly defined grounds for termination protects staff, clients, visitors, and others from potential harm or disruptive behavior and holds everyone accountable for creating a safe and secure environment. It also helps create a supportive and positive community built on dignity, respect, and collaboration. Each client may be working on individual goals and when an environment where clients see their accomplishments as positively impacting the community is created, it can make a greater impact. The grounds for discharge encompasses a procedure on the program level and includes a list of rules that are provided to clients at intake. \nLifeMoves strives to create an environment of safety for all those onsite. For safety reasons, clients will be subject to discharge for violating any of the rules listed"
