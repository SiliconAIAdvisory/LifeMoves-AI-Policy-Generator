Service-enriched shelters are distinguished from basic shelters by the provision of services, such as case management, substance abuse treatment, and/or mental health counseling, which support residents' transition to stability.\n\n# TRANSITIONAL HOUSING\n\nFor the purposes of these standards, \"TRANSITIONAL HOUSING\" must comply with the standards of service-enriched shelters except where existing law requires a different standard. Transitional housing programs offer housing combined with an array of support services, for an extended, but not permanent length of time where clients may pay a percentage of their income towards their housing cost. Transitional housing is designed to provide people with the structure and support they need to address critical issues contributing to their homelessness and to teach the skills necessary to maintain permanent housing and maximum self-sufficiency.\n\n# BEDROOM\n\nThe term \"BEDROOM\", as used in the ensuing standards,"
