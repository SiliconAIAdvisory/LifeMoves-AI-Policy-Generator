Internet provider and site setup is determined by the City of San José.\n\n# Computer and Office\n\n# Technology Support\n\nAll EIH sites are encouraged to provide technology support to participants. This might include access to Chromebooks and other office equipment to support housing and employment goals (e.g., job searches, housing research, interview preparation).\n\n# Food Pantry\n\nEach EIH site partners with local agencies to donate pantry and refrigerated food and make them available to all participants. EIH sites provide space in the shared kitchen for items that participants need to be refrigerated or items that require dry storage. Sites provide each participant with a rodent- and insect-resistant container for dry storage use that can be identified for their personal use only. Sites allow participants to store perishable foods they purchased with their own resources in the shared refrigerator, labeled for personal use. Sites develop policies to ensure that participants can store and access their personal food items in shared spaces with easy access 24/7.\n\n# Storage\n\nEach EIH site offers all participants storage for their personal belongings. At a minimum, sites provide space for storage in a participant’s personal living space and outside the personal living space that participants can easily access for dry storage of food, bicycles, and items"
