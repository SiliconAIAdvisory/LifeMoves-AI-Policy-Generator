For example, survivors of gender-based violence will benefit from a designated EIH site that can meet their unique needs.\n\nPortland State University’s Homelessness Research and Action Collaborative’s Village Research How to Guide suggests maintaining an approximate ratio of ten participants without significant behavioral health conditions to one participant with significant behavioral health conditions in order to balance caseloads and allow meaningful interactions between case managers and participants.4 Based on the Portland State Guide, the ratio for higher-acuity sites should prioritize lower staff-to-participant caseload ratios with no greater than 1:20 as a best practice.\n\n# Sites Serving Participants with Lower-Acuity Needs\n\nEIH sites serving participants with lower-acuity needs will primarily serve participants who fall into the Rapid Rehousing range on Santa Clara County’s prioritization assessment tool (currently the Vulnerability Index-Service Prioritization Decision Assistance Tool). Because lower acuity participants need to identify permanent housing, collect necessary documentation, and identify employment and/or mainstream benefits to ensure long-term housing stability, they still require staff-to-participant caseload ratios of no more than 1:30.5\n\n# Security\n\nEIH sites prioritize securing the perimeter and keeping participants safe from events going on outside"
