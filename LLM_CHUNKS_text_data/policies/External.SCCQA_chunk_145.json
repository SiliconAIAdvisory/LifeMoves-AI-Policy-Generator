OSH staff will provide human judgment and discretion in making referrals based upon the prioritization and match-making methodology laid out in this document. Discretion may include taking into account a client’s known preferences when making matches, avoiding referrals to programs where an individual/household has had a serious violation in the past, and addressing inconsistencies or concerns in the assessment or eligibility information entered in HMIS. Any match that requires some flexibility outside the methodology described here requires approval from an OSH senior manager.\n\n# B. Provider Responsibilities\n\nWhen a permanent housing program receives a referral in HMIS, the provider will follow these steps:\n\n1. Locate the individual/household: It is expected that the provider will make at least 3-5 reasonable attempts to find the individual/household. In addition to trying the contact\n\ninformation in the person’s HMIS account, attempts should include seeking the person out in locations and at other service providers that they are known to frequent.\n\n1. All attempts to find the individual/household must be documented in HMIS.\n2. Verify eligibility: Information in the individual’s/household’s HMIS account (including the VI-SPDAT) is primarily self-reported. Providers will need to conduct their own"
