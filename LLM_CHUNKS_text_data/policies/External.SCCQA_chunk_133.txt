The VI-SPDAT can only be conducted by staff or volunteers who have successfully completed training and been authorized by OSH.

The purpose of the training is to provide all staff who administer assessments with access to materials that clearly describe the methods by which assessments are to be conducted with fidelity to the CoCâ€™s coordinated assessment written policies and procedures.
