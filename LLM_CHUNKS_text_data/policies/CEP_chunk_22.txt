Financial Moves
COVID-19 changed the way many of us work in Silicon Valley, and while wages have been increasing in some sectors, many of our clients continue to work in jobs that simply do not pay a living wage for the Bay Area. To address this barrier, LifeMoves Employment Specialists focus on helping our adult clients increase their employment opportunities and earning potential through employment skills training, resume development, job searching training, and interview coaching. This work supports our clients who are unemployed and underemployed, so they are better prepared to transition back to stable housing with reliable employment. Additionally, the LifeMoves employment team provides specialized training programs and partners with multiple organzations for additional opportunities. LifeMoves offers our clients a deeper level of financial training to better prepare them for success in the future. Focused on the goal of long-term stability, we provide workshops, as well as individual coaching, on topics such as budgeting, building, and repairing credit, savings strategies, and techniques for borrowing money wisely.
