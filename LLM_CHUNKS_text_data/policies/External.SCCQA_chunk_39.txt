 cultural differences associated with race, religious creed, color, national origin, ancestry, language, disability (physical or mental health), medical condition, marital status, familial status, age, sex or gender identity, sexual orientation, source of income, or political affiliation.

# G.

At no point shall program access be denied because of an individual's disability. Moreover, a program may not apply different rules to individuals because of their disabilities, unless the different rules are a result of granting a reasonable accommodation request made by an individual with a disability.

# H.

Clients with disabilities are entitled to reasonable accommodations. If a client requests a change in a program's policy or procedure as an accommodation of his/her disability, the program should grant the accommodation when the accommodation is both reasonable and necessary because of the individual's disability. Such an accommodation request must be considered during any stage in the provision of a program, including at intake, during services, and during discharge proceedings. When a reasonable accommodation request is made, the program supervisor may request medical verification of the individual's disability.

# I. Service Animals

1. Programs providing emergency shelter and/or services must allow service animals to accompany people with disabilities in all areas of a program facility where clients are normally allowed to go.
