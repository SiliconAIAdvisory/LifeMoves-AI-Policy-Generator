    "text": "Title, Topic or Reference: LifeMoves Client Engagement Philosophy January 2024\n\n and location information.\n\nCommon Spaces \nProviding our clients with access to common spaces including kitchens, food pantries, playgrounds, quiet rooms, bathrooms, etc. are key to our model of self-sufficiency and stability. These spaces vary across programs and are determined by the site layout and structure. Each program posts signs with norms and staff ensure clients are collaborating to maintain clean, safe, and inviting common spaces for all to enjoy.\n\nFood and Kitchen: \nMeals are provided as a service to all clients; however, clients may buy their own food to eat in the facility dining areas. Clients’ personal food or drink should be stored in individual units as common storage is limited. \nClients may request reasonable accommodations for dining exceptions to their Case Manager.\n\nBicycles \nTransportation is an important resource for our clients to have mobility and autonomy to access resources that are not located at LifeMoves facilities. A few of our shelter programs provide bicycles that can be checked out and utilized by clients, others can provide a bike to a client when they gain employment or housing, and others provide bicycle storage. Information about bicycle storage norms and check out procedures are posted near the bicycles at each site and includes information about free bike locks and helmets.\n\n•\tM"
