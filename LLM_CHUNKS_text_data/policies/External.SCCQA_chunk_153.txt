# D. Housing Referrals

When an anonymous client from a domestic violence service provider receives a housing referral, OSH staff will contact the service provider. It is the responsibility of the service provider to reach out to the client and connect them with the housing provider. The standard policies regarding the length of time to look for someone and the individual’s/household’s right to decline a referral still apply.
