Program Model Philosophy
LifeMoves provides client-centered, trauma-informed, strengths focused, and culturally responsive services to neighbors experiencing or facing homelessness. We prioritize the safety and well being of clients and staff, while aiming to create open & transparent settings that aid in client progress. Data and feedback are foundational to our program model. We take a multi-disciplinary approach to our work, collaborating internally and with external partners to target each clientâ€™s unique goals and needs. Consistency is key and relentless engagement ensures we meet clients on their terms. Program staff emphasize dignity and respect to empower our clients, ensuring that each person we serve is recognized, valued, and supported on their journey toward stability and independence.
